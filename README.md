# Thistle template

A basic bootstrap design inspired by an [image i saw while scrolling down my facebook's newsfeed](https://i.imgur.com/DXINY4Z.jpg), the main goal was to get comfortable using [bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) even though i don't really like it :smile:, i also started using [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) which i can't live without anymore, and built a solid understanding of how colors work on the web and on digital displays in general, which made me spend 2 days trying to calibrate my monitors and use the mobile phone of every single human being i know to see if the design looks decent.
